| Scoring                   | A scoring is a value related to a lead, where we want to see **how hot this lead is**.<br>This means: The more scoring the lead have, the more business-relevant is this lead.<br>So, scoring is just a factor for us to see how interested the lead is - or if the lead wants to do business with us.<br>A scoring can also decrease if the last visit from the lead was some time ago. |
| Category-Scoring          | While a scoring tells us if a lead is hot, we still don't in which product or service the lead is interested in.<br>Here comes the category scoring. You can have unlimited categories and a scoring related to category with **Product A** will tell us, if the lead is interested in the product.<br>A category-scoring will not decrease, even if the visit was some time ago. |
| Nurturing                 | Lead-Nurturing means to develop a lead. Tell your leads relevant information and let them know how your business could help them. If you do this step by step, you will develop your leads - you will nurture your leads. |

| Workflow                  | A workflow is a combination of one or more triggers and one or more actions to nurture your leads.     |
| Workflow Trigger          | A trigger is a point of action this will cause an action. A known trigger could be e.g. *the second website visit*. |
