#### Detail Preview

If you click in a table row, a small lead preview will be loaded via AJAX. Both diagrams on the right side will be
replaced with a preview box and a scoring box.

<img src="../../../Documentation/Images/documentation_leads_list_detail.png" width="800" />

If you add a text into the textarea *Add an individual description*, this notice is saved automaticly if the focus gets
lost on the field (on blur).

Clicking on *Show lead details* will open the detail page.




#### Detail View

The detail view will give you a couple of information of the chosen lead. The view is splitted into 5 boxes:
* Lead information
* Lead scoring
* Activity log
* Conversion funnel / Page visits
* Categoryscoring

##### Lead information

See all relevant lead information.

It starts with the *Lead identification*. Depending on the information we have, this
will show the email or the first- and lastname or simply "Anonymous".
Beside this, you will see the general scoring and the hottest category scoring (if there is one). A click on the google
icon will open a new tab with google and let you search for the lead.

After the first line, there are information that came from field mapping, meta information (first and last
visit) and information enriched by the visitors IP-address. The description field is also shown and can be used in the
same way as described in *Detail Preview*.

##### Lead scoring

See the lead scoring of the lead in the last 6 weeks. That gives you the possibility to decide, how your nurturing
workflows are running.

**Note:** The scoring calculation can be done in the Extension Manager settings of the extension. If you are using
the value *lastVisitDaysAgo*, you should use a CommandController to calculate the lead scoring one time a day.

##### Activity log

*Lead gets identified by email4link" or "Lead downloads an asset". Also every workflow that takes action on this lead

##### Interaction Buttons

On the bottom of the detail view, you will find three buttons.

* Go back: Browser will show the previous page
* Ignore in future: This lead will be ignored from now on. This means, the lead is not visible in any view any more. This is helpful, if you identify a searchengine crawler (maybe with a high scoring).
* Remove completely: This will remove all information about this lead from your system. Remove means that the records are really remove - not only a deleted=1!
